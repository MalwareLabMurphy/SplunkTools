# Linux Auditd Investigation
This SPL is intended to be used to aid in investigations where multiple command arguments need to be parsed throughout an Auditd log file.
Use this query for either a quick investigation/threat hunt, or as a panel for a persistent dashboard for investigating Linux CLI activity.
Don't forget to replace the bracketed text with values that match your deployment, as specified in the comments!

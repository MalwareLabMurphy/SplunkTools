# Detection Library
This SPL can be used as a quick query or a persistent dashboard panel for quickly querying your detection holdings.
The intent of the search is to query against your SPL so that you can quickly find specific logic, queries, typos, etc. within a set of detections. Although it is coded to search against all of a saved search's logic, it is intended to only display the "main query" of the detection for quick reference.
Don't forget to modify the bracketed text as indicated within the comments of the code!
